Only safe functions can be called in an adequate manner on a signal handler. This happens because unsafe functions (like printf(), for instance) can be interrupted by signals handlers.
Being interrupted by signal handlers will call again printf() and due to that interruption this printf() may print inconsistent information.
Thus, all functions mentioned in "man signal-safety" can be used.
