In signal manual, it says to avoid the use of signal() and use sigaction() instead, thus we (the group) assume that sigaction() is way more viable.

Sigaction function will block other signals until a receive a return value, however signal function , doesn't block other signals.

Sigaction function is also way more complete that signal (more parameters).
